<h1 align="center">Hello everynyan!</h1>

<br clear="both">

<p align="left">I'm Hunor, and welcome to my extremely professional github page 😎</p><br>

###
<h2 align="center">Technologies I'm Familiar With</h2>
<p><i>I am definitely one of the software developers of all time</i></p><br>
<p>I have a varied skillset, not including, yet not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Video Games 🎮</strong>, which I'm the most passionate about, mostly using the Unity engine (not for long) and C# (also not for long) <i>(7+ years as of 2025)</i></li>
<li><strong>C++ 🌊➕➕</strong>, my most beloved singular project being my own game engine that I'm working on as my university capstone project, which will replace unity as soon as I am done with all the features I tend to use</li>
<li><strong>Frontend and backend applications 👉👈</strong> using React (+ electron), typescript and Node.js, but php/laravel, Vue or angular also works if you ask nicely enough <i>(6+ years as of 2025) ((With actual job experience))</i></li>
<li><strong>Miscellaneous languages/technologies🗑️🔥</strong> such as C, Java, Python and Lua for smaller projects like personal tools or mods for different videogames</li>
</ul><br>

<h2 align="center">Featured Projects</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Petrichor Game Engine 🚂</strong>: My custom game engine written in C++. I'm trying my best to keep the number of external libraries low, to familiarise myself with every aspect of engine development. Built on SDL3 and OpenGL 3.3 (for now, might change to Vulkan if it proves more useful). Currently in develpoment, but it will feature a fully functional GUI similar to Unity's or UE's (more functional at points than those two tbh), all the dev tools <strong>I</strong> deem important (later on I <i>might</i> listen to feedback, depends if they're nice about it) and whatever else a game engine usually does.</li>
<li><strong>A Web-Based Desktop Game 🖥️</strong>: A nicely polished videogame for my high-school capstone project, 3 of us worked on it, I was coding most of the actual game login and frontend, but definitely had my hand on the backend side as well. It teaches the basics of web development to people featuring a code editor (thank you microsoft), and real-time updates on the sites you're debugging. Reviews aren't public thanks to the nature of the project but people did seem to enjoy it a lot, even ones who don't know how programming works</li>
<li><strong>Some smaller projects</strong>, including 🥱: A small Calendar Manager for my university studies, a User Story Diagram Generator also for my university studies and an Anki (language learning app) Card Generator, surprisingly not for my university studies, most of which you can find on my GitHub pages site, or buried in my repositories (oh, all the dead game projects you'll never get to see, really sad honestly)</li>
</ul><br>

<h2 align="center">Where to find me 🔎</h2>

<p align="left">Yeah, that's all for now. If I get some ideas what to write here maybe I'll expand it a bit. Also my repo readmes are all over the place, some well-written, some... not so much... If you have any questions I'd be happy to answer!<br>
